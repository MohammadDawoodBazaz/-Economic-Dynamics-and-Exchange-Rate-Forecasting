# -Economic-Dynamics-and-Exchange-Rate-Forecasting
The analysis focuses on the nominal and real exchange rates and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for both countries. Using a robust dataset, the team performs logarithmic transformations of key variables, analyzes their statistical properties, and tests the validity of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) in both absolute and relative forms.
he ARIMA modeling technique is employed to forecast the real exchange rate, assessing multiple models to find the best fit. The study combines quantitative analysis with existing economic literature to provide comprehensive insights.
Key tasks include data gathering, cleaning, preparation, and analysis using Python. The project challenges traditional PPP expectations, uncovering complex dynamics influenced by factors beyond inflation and currency valuation, such as political stability and market speculation. The findings contribute to understanding international economic
